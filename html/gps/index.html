<<!-->The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is that so the code makes sense both to human and computers. Main, article, and section seems more important than the others because those define the contents of the page.
The browser shows what is most important content on the page by the size of headings.
Through the challege I learned that Sublime can be customized with pre-destined bone layout to facilitate a job. I definitely will create more snippets in the future as I learn of my necessities along the way.
I am still having little problem understanding the usage of semantic tags. How does each individual tag perform differently on a page? Guess these will be answered along my voyage.
