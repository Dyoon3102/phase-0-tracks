What sorts of resources will help? 

- A google search on jquery resource
- A search for a jquery cheat sheet
- A quick look through codecademy
- Some example jquery codes and try to understand how the code works

How often should you stop and test what you just learned? 

- Unless you know exactly how the code works, it should be tested until completely understood

Are breaks important? 

- Breaks will be extremely important, instead of trying to think through a struggle, I think it'll be best to rest and let your mind reset and that will mostly help to give you a different perspective on a struggle.

Which strategies seemed to be the most effective?

- First thing was to learn the mechanism of jquery via codecademy.com. Went through most steps to learn the basics of working with jquery.
- Next, was to look for a jquery cheat sheet and had it bookmarked for future references.
- Last, was to go to jquery.com on API documentations and go through most so I could get a basic idea of the structure. Tested on codes that didn't make sense until I clearly understood.

** I extended my 2 hours to 10 more minutes for jquery installation on my system.
