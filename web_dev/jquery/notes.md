What sorts of resources will help? 

- A google search on jquery resource
- A search for a jquery cheat sheet
- A quick look through codecademy
- Some example jquery codes and try to understand how the code works

How often should you stop and test what you just learned? 

- Unless you know exactly how the code works, it should be tested until completely understood

Are breaks important? 

- Breaks will be extremely important, instead of trying to think through a struggle, I think it'll be best to rest and let your mind reset and that will mostly help to give you a different perspective on a struggle.
