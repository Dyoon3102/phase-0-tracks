2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses, reviews, users WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|Verizon|1|3|Average service|1|6|6|Halle|Berry
2|Daily Bagels|2|1|Rotten bagels|2|4|4|Albert|Pujols
3|Apple|3|5|I really like their MacBooks|3|5|5|Hillary|Clinton
4|Giovanni's Pizza|4|2|Not enough cheese|4|2|2|LeBron|James

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
Verizon|3|Average service|Halle|Berry
Daily Bagels|1|Rotten bagels|Albert|Pujols
Apple|5|I really like their MacBooks|Hillary|Clinton
Giovanni's Pizza|2|Not enough cheese|LeBron|James

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name = "Verizon";
