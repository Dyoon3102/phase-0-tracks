-Release 2-

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> SELECT * FROM cars;
1|Chevy|Malibu|2005|false|1
2|Acura|MDX|2010|true|3
3|Porsche|911|2003|true|2
4|Toyota|Rav-4|2015|false|3

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> UPDATE cars SET year=2013, moon_roof="true" WHERE id=4;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM cars;
1|Chevy|Malibu|2005|false|1
2|Acura|MDX|2010|true|3
3|Porsche|911|2003|true|2
4|Toyota|Rav-4|2013|true|3

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM cars, types WHERE cars.types_id = types.id;    
1|Chevy|Malibu|2005|false|1|1|sedan
2|Acura|MDX|2010|true|3|3|sport utility
3|Porsche|911|2003|true|2|2|coupe
4|Toyota|Rav-4|2013|true|3|3|sport utility

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT cars.make, cars.model, types.name FROM cars JOIN types ON cars.types_id = types.id;
Chevy|Malibu|sedan
Acura|MDX|sport utility
Porsche|911|coupe
Toyota|Rav-4|sport utility

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> SELECT * FROM cars;
1|Chevy|Malibu|2005|false|1
2|Acura|MDX|2010|true|3
4|Toyota|Rav-4|2013|true|3

-Release 3-

1. There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?

Different kinds of joins: Inner, Left, Right, Full Outer.
Yes, there are conditional joins by attaching command of “WHERE”

2. Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM cars;
1|Chevy|Malibu|2005|false|1
2|Acura|MDX|2010|true|3
3|Ferrari|Enzo|2003|true|2
4|Toyota|Rav-4|2013|true|3
5|Porsche|911|2003|false|2

sqlite> SELECT * FROM types;
1|sedan
2|coupe
3|sport utility

sqlite> SELECT cars.model, cars.make, types.name FROM cars JOIN types ON cars.types_id = types.id WHERE types.id = 3;
MDX|Acura|sport utility
Rav-4|Toyota|sport utility

sqlite> SELECT cars.make, cars.model, types.name FROM cars INNER JOIN types ON cars.types_id = types.id;
Chevy|Malibu|sedan
Acura|MDX|sport utility
Ferrari|Enzo|coupe
Toyota|Rav-4|sport utility
Porsche|911|coupe

sqlite> SELECT cars.make, cars.model, types.name FROM cars LEFT JOIN types ON cars.types_id = types.id WHERE cars.id=2;
Acura|MDX|sport utility
